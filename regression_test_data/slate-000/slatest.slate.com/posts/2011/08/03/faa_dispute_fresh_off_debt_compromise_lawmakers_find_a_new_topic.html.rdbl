At least&#160;comparatively speaking.<br/></p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday announced a deal to reopen the FAA and bring an end to the two-week standoff that had idled tens of thousands of workers and stalled construction projects across the nation.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>"This agreement does not resolve the important differences that still remain," Reid said. "But I believe we should keep Americans working while Congress settles its differences, and this agreement will do exactly that."</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>Reid did not specify details of the deal in his statement, but congressional aides say they expect the Senate to accept the House-passed bill as early as Friday, the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/04/reid-announces-deal-to-end-faa-shutdown/">Associated Press</a> reports.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p><strong>ORIGINAL POST Wednesday at 5:32 p.m.:</strong> The months-long stalemate over the debt ceiling may have finally come to an end, but that doesn&#8217;t mean fans of political bickering and partisan gridlock are out of luck.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>The latest battle is over aviation funding, a dispute that has idled tens of thousands of Americans, stalled construction projects across the nation, and forced safety inspectors to cover their own travel expenses while working without pay, <em><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60602.html#ixzz1U0DJIQfV">Politico</a></em> reports.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>President Obama has urged lawmakers to return to Washington to end the latest impasse and approve temporary financing for the Federal Aviation Administration. But as should come as no surprise by now, that appears to be a long shot.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><blockquote>Administration officials on Tuesday asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to pass a House bill reauthorizing the aviation agency, even though it contains cost-cutting provisions the White House and congressional Democrats oppose.</blockquote></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><blockquote>Mr. Reid rebuffed the request and instead followed the House and adjourned the Senate for its August recess. Lawmakers aren't scheduled to return until after Labor Day.</blockquote></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>Democrats instead want the House GOP to agree to a temporary spending measure without the cuts, and are accusing Republicans of playing the role of hostage taker to get their way.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>&#8220;Unfortunately, Republicans continue to practice the politics of confrontation and hostage-taking,&#8221; Steny Hoyer, the House&#8217;s No. 2 Democrat, said Wednesday.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>Sen. Barbara Boxer also found a way to work the latest Democratic sound bite into her remarks. &#8220;This is a made-up crisis,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is government by hostage taking.&#8221;</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>Republicans, meanwhile, counter that it is Democrats who are aren&#8217;t playing fair. They point to comments Reid made earlier this week suggesting that he&#8217;d be ready to sign off on the House bill to solve the dispute.</p></div></div><div class="text parbase section"><div class="text"><p>&#8220;The only reason 80,000 jobs are at stake is that Senate Democratic leaders chose to play politics rather than keep their word and pass the House bill,&#8221; said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. &#8220;That&#8217;s indefensible, and they should end this crisis immediately.&#8221;</p></div></div></div></div><p class="clearing"/><div class="caption"><p>

We&#8217;re just generating lots of business right now,&#8221; said Brian Hanson, managing director at CW Financial Services, which had the country&#8217;s second-largest special-servicing business as of the beginning of the year.</p><p>Hanson said CW is actively servicing more than 1,200 loans worth more than $23&#160;billion.</p><p>When they are assigned to manage a loan that is delinquent or potentially in trouble,  servicers typically start down two paths simultaneously: one toward foreclosure and another toward a loan modification that would allow the borrower to remain the owner.</p><p>Hanson said the company has been considering more loan modifications &#8212; or &#8220;workouts&#8221; &#8212; in recent months as property values in some markets have stabilized and more borrowers come up with cash to shore up their positions. </p><p>&#8220;It seems like there&#8217;s a little bit better opportunity to do workouts in this market,&#8221; Hanson said. &#8220;Property owners may be seeing more light at the end of the tunnel, perhaps, or there is more of a chance of them contributing more capital.&#8221; </p><p>But nearly three years after Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy, the majority of distressed real estate loans remain in limbo. Of almost $350&#160;billion of the commercial real estate debt that has become distressed since the recession, only about half has reached a resolution, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research firm.</p><p>David Kahn, a partner in the Washington office and the real estate practice of Holland &amp; Knight, is among those who wonder why a resilient market such as Washington&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t seen more  workouts.</p><p>&#8220;Despite all the hearsay talk about the workouts that are going on,&#8221; Kahn said, &#8220;we have not seen many of them that have reached the finish line.&#8221;</p><p>
<strong>A niche field takes off</strong>
</p><p>So why haven&#8217;t there been more workouts? </p><p>First, there&#8217;s a reason servicing is such a niche field &#8212; it isn&#8217;t as simple as just getting a lender and a borrower to sit down and agree on a new deal. Major purchases during the go-go years of real estate were bundled and securitized as bonds. Investors of all kinds bought different slices of the same loans, and a workout that might make sense for one could wipe others out of the deal completely.</p><p>&#8220;The most senior bondholders have a certain investment strategy in mind, and the same thing with the junior bondholders,&#8221; Hanson said. &#8220;And they may be the same and they may not. But if there is a change in strategy that would affect all of the bondholders, it is easy to see how there could be a dispute between bondholders.&#8221;</p></article></div><div id="page-3" class="article-page"><article><p>The third possible reason is a blockbuster: Servicers might not be acting<b/>in good faith to facilitate workouts, according to industry sources, so the servicers themselves &#8212; armed with information about the properties and the loans &#8212; can scoop up real estate on the cheap, according to industry sources. Although they are bound by the contracts governing each loan they service, in most cases servicers also have an option to buy properties they help liquidate.</p><p>This theory is given ammunition by the entrance of high-profile investors into the special-servicing field since the recession. Four of the top five largest servicers in the country have been acquired since late 2009, when <a href="http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=BRK/A">Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway  </a>formed a partnership that bought Capmark Financial Group.</p><p>Not six months later, another big-name investor, Andrew Farkas, made his own splash when his <a href="http://bit.ly/lfpv9X">Island Capital Group bought Centerline</a>, one of the country&#8217;s leading servicers and the company that was handling Beacon Capital&#8217;s Seattle and D.C. portfolios. Centerline was renamed C-III Capital Partners, and Farkas moved to strengthen C-III by agreeing to purchase another services firm, NAI Global, last month.</p><p>Two more deals came in the second half of last year. A combination of firms led by New York&#8217;s Vornado Realty Trust, a firm with major holdings in the Washington area, <a href="http://buswk.co/lCWwnX">acquired a major stake in LNR Property</a> of Miami, and Fortress Investment Group, a New York private-equity firm, <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100701005709/en/Fortress-Funds-Purchase-CW-Financial-Services">bought CW Financial Services</a>. </p><p>Some of the deals stoked speculation that these new owners might be interested in a lot more than fees from service work.  </p><p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s absolutely incentive on the part of some of the buyers of these pieces to be in a position to get a hold of some of these properties,&#8221; said Steve Miller, director of U.S. debt and risk research for CoStar Group, a real estate data firm.</p><p>But Miller cautioned that the servicers&#8217; position is valuable only if the properties can be had at an attractive price.</p><p>&#8220;They bought an option to acquire properties,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If the market clearing level is pretty low, that&#8217;s worth something. If the market clearing level is rich for their blood, their option is useless.&#8221;</p><p>Said Trepp&#8217;s Clancy: &#8220;It&#8217;s very interesting. We haven&#8217;t really reconciled how they could do that easily. These special servicers have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize the recovery to bondholders, [so] you would be hard pressed to do that under the responsibilities that the servicers have. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t expect a press release if it were happening.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed when two titans of commercial real estate, Sam Zell and Steve Roth, chairman of Vornado, took the stage at the Warner Theater in March as guests of a local Realtors group, Zell suggested that Roth had bought into LNR to acquire that option to buy properties the company was servicing.</p></article></div></div>

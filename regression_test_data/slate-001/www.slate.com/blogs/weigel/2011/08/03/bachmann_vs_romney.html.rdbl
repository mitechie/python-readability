            </div><div id="page-2" class="article-page"><div class="text"><p>The solution: Kicking out the Birchers and GOProud, which looks to be well underway. Alana Goodman <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/08/03/conservative-political-action-conference/">explains</a> the problem with that, but she's late to the game -- Andrew Breitbart <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/tatler/2011/07/30/roger-l-simon-backs-breitbart-on-goproud-v-cpac/">seems to be leading</a> a phalanx of left coast conservatives, who celebrated GOProud with a party last year, out of the conference. How many people? I'd guess a minimal amount -- all of them just happen to be extraordinarily good at getting media attention. Ejecting one group from a conference isn't an historic event, especially <a href="http://metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=5987">when you factor in</a> the unique bad blood between GOProud and the ACU board. But it does feel like a reshuffle in the conservative elite. When Barack Obama's Democrats controlled everything, it was all conservatives in the foxhole. Obama looks beatable now, and the GOP House is <a href="http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2011/08/al-cardenas-wife-diana-gays-are-in-our-faces-with-public-display-of-affection-gay-parades-gay-rallie.html">winning as much</a> as Newt Gingrich's House ever did. The flash of GOProud, with their hotline to Donald Trump, isn't as necessary.</p></div></div><div id="page-3" class="article-page"><div class="text"><p>Insofar as they actually understood what the hell was in it, this <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-08-03-poll-debt-agreement_n.htm">USAT/Gallup poll</a> is both inspiring and depressing. Inspiring, because it seems like they actually understand the effects of spending cuts on short-term job growth.</p><blockquote>In the survey, 41% say the deal will make the economy worse; 17% say it will make it better. A third predict it won't have much effect.</blockquote><p>Among the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2300528/">41 percent:</a> Democrats who voted for the deal! The Democrats who opposed it were usually a little more honest about the choice. Rep. Jesse Jackson, D-Ill., whose resilience in office despite <a href="http://www.theroot.com/buzz/jesse-jackson-jr-embroiled-cheating-scandal">multiple scandals</a> threatens to turn this into an item about negative effects of ultra-safe racial gerrymandering, opposed the deal but said the choice was between "job-killing default and job-killing austerity." And it was.</p><p>We're mocking the White House <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/03/obama-vows-to-pivot-to-jobs-republicans-question-track-record/">now for announcing</a> yet another to "pivot to jobs" -- depending on how you count the articles and reports, there have been 12 of these since Obama took office. Fair enough. But the initial "pivots to jobs" actually led to job growth. Take it away, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_07/privatesector_job_creation_det030742.php">Steve Benen</a>, with your chart showing job numbers during months of Bush's presidency in red and months of Obama's presidency in blue.</p><p><img src="http://wamo.info/pa/110708_privatejobs.jpg"/></p><p>See there? Job creation. Just not enough of it, which allows Obama critics to say that spending didn't work and imply that spending cuts will. Washington seemed to believe that voters agreed. But they didn't -- they don't believe in Keynesianism, and they're despondent about the other choices.<br/></p></div></div><div id="page-4" class="article-page"><div class="text"><p>Things could be worse for Barack Obama on this, the day before the 50th anniversary of his birth. After being goaded and goaded and goaded over three years, he released his long-form birth certificate. Birtherism as we once knew it is dead.</p><p>Sort of. One reason birtherism survived as long as it did is that it was such a cash cow for fringe right activists. WorldNetDaily schlepped some untold amount of "Where's the Birth Certificate" merch, promoting it all with news stories on its website. How are they living after birtherism died?</p><p>Oh.</p><p><a title="wndbumper by daveweigel1981, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58372028@N00/6006197788/"><img alt="wndbumper" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/6006197788_3527c09ca1.jpg"/></a></p><p>While the rest of us moved on, WND just <a href="http://superstore.wnd.com/SUBSCRIPTIONS/wheres-the-real-birth-certificate-billboard-campaign">redesigned the WTBC merch</a> and slapped an extra word on it. The merchandise accompanies fresh stories on WND's site, including one that attempts to prove that the long-form is fake because "no expert has been able to replicate the effects seen in the Obama birth certificate PDF by scanning a document, even with OCR software switched on and the resulting PDF optimized." Some more time with WND's new birtherism trove leads us to revelations <a href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=296881#ixzz1TzxNnrQD">like this one:</a> </p><blockquote><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=311433">Retired Maj. Gen. Paul Vallely,</a> the chief of <a href="http://standupamericaus.com/">Stand Up America, </a>a national security expert and Fox News contributor, says the "Certificate of Live Birth" released in April by the White House is a forgery, but the FBI is covering the fraud and no one in Congress is willing to tackle the situation because of fears of a "black backlash" if the failings of the nation's first black president are revealed.</blockquote><p>That's a FOIA I want to read. WND has long moved beyond the conspiracies of Orly Taitz, which seems wise, because she's doing even worse with this stuff. Her incomprehensible theory that Obama is using someone else's Social Security number has it a snag, because she repeatedly <a href="http://articles.ocregister.com/2011-07-29/news/29834202_1_orly-taitz-clay-d-land-court-clerk">screwed up</a> the redacting of that info on her lawsuits, leading a judge to determine that she was "either toying with the Court or displaying her own stupidity." <a href="http://www.orlytaitzesq.com/?p=24417">On her blog</a>, Taitz is reduced to begging fans for information about Hawaiians or leftists who, in theory, could have aided the Obama parents in a massive conspiracy.</p><p>From the center of the Donald Trump campaign to here. It would be sad, if the actors weren't so obviously dishonest.<br/></p></div></div><div id="page-5" class="article-page"><div class="text"><p>The trend in the South is for Democratic legislators to realize how completely doomed they are and run over to the GOP. So <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/08/01/2341052/ex-gop-senator-to-run-for-house.html">this stands</a> out.<br/></p><blockquote>Former GOP state Sen. Nancy Argenziano says she will run for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat. Argenziano will seek the District 2 seat in North Florida now held by freshman Republican Steve Southerland, who unseated longtime Democrat Allen Boyd in November 2010.</blockquote><p>This isn't as big as it seems at first, because Argenziano served in the Crist administration and worked for the Democratic candidate for governor against Rick Scott -- although <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2264898/">lots of Republicans had problems</a> with Rick Scott. Her <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5m8GGdIAIrsJ:www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/sites/tampabay.com.blogs.the-buzz-florida-politics/files/argenzianoletter.doc+%22We+have+seen+our+representatives+vote+to+end+common+sense+protections+that+ensure+clean+air+and+clean+water,+pass+the+Ryan+plan+which+proposed+to+gut+Social+Security+and+end+Medicare%27&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=www.google.com">rationale</a> for leaving the party makes you wonder how she ever was a Republican.<br/></p><blockquote>We know that Washington is broken. We have seen our representatives vote to end common sense protections that ensure clean air and clean water, pass the Ryan plan which proposed to gut Social Security and end Medicare, put the full faith and credit of America in doubt for the first time in history, and vote against protecting America's wildlife from extinction, among other steps backward into the 16th century. These efforts have sent America down a dangerous path. It's time for knowledgeable, reasoned Americans to take charge and lead... The Republican Party has left me, and I will run as a Democrat, in a sense permitting a claim to ultimate bipartisanship, along the lines of Ronald Reagan. The current iteration of the party abandoned real republican principles long ago to cater to ideologues and corporations &#8211; the Koch entities, most notably &#8211; whose interests lie in the profiteering of America and the sacking of the middle class. Current Republican leaders have neither patience with nor allowance for honest elected officials, and they demand that members of the various legislatures &#8211; who, after all, have sworn to uphold the Constitution &#8211; instead just follow the hijacked party line and shut up.<br/></blockquote><p>A new Crist in the making! Her chances of victory have everything to do with what comes out of a legal battle over the state's voter-passed redistricting reform. Florida votes roughly 50-50 at the presidential level; last year's gubernatorial race was 50/50. And yet the state sends 18 Republicans and only 7 Democrats to the House, because of the grand bargain between Republicans who want safe districts and black Democrats who want even safer ones. The prime mover in the lawsuit, Corrine Brown, gets to represent a district that combines most of the black parts of the Jacksonville area, the Orlando area, and central Florida into a unit that voted 3-1 for Obama over McCain. It looks like this.</p><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/FL03_109.gif"/><br/></p><p>I know, right? If Florida's broken back up into even districts, this candidacy will be worth watching -- an angry progressive Republican versus a Tea Partier.<br/></p></div></div></div>

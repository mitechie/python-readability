        <p>It has been two weeks since Netflix announced, much to the chagrin of its loyal user base, that it would be hiking its monthly subscription prices by 60 percent for users who want both streaming and discs. How have things been going for the company since then? If you were to ask some parts of the Internet, Netflix is about to crash and burn. But according to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, there haven't been very many complaints.</p>

<p>Netflix announced earlier this month that it was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2011/07/dvd-only-and-streaming-only-netflix-plans-now-799-each.ars">splitting out its streaming and DVD plans</a> and pricing them at $7.99 apiece per month&#8212;up from $9.99 per month for streaming <em>and</em> one DVD at a time. Assuming you want to keep both services (and not everyone does), that's $5.99 more per month for the same level of service, or $71.88 more per year. The company said it had decided to bump prices because there's still a large demand for DVDs, and splitting the services would make better financial sense for the company.</p>  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2011/07/netflix-ceo-fewer-complaints-than-expected-over-price-hike.ars" class="read-more">( More &hellip; )</a>         </div>

<p>Copyright holding groups are always coming up with creative ideas for the classification and ranking of content. Here's another that hadn't occurred to us. Why not ask search engines to attach "red light" symbols next to sites categorized as a "risk" and put green ticks next to sites deemed safer?</p>
 <p>That's exactly what a United Kingdom music copyright royalty collection organization proposes. </p>
 <p>"Traffic Lights provide a visual indication to users approaching an unlicensed site that the site is facilitating copyright theft," explains the <a href="http://www.prsformusic.com/Pages/default.aspx">Performing Rights Society for Music's</a> new plan (<a href="http://static.arstechnica.com/PRS%20for%20Music%20Traffic%20Lights%20Proposal.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>"The traffic light&#8212;a green tick or red cross&#8212;would appear next to a link to the site in question. The traffic light can be applied wherever the site is, not just those in the UK, increasing the ability of consumers to protect themselves from sites hosted abroad and increasing their confidence in legitimate sites."</p>  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2011/07/stop-red-site-copyright-group-proposes-traffic-light-search-ticks.ars" class="read-more">( More &hellip; )</a>         </div>

        <div class="teaser">
        <p>Google's search engine has <a href="http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=1182191">started warning</a> users that they've installed certain malware. "Your computer appears to be infected," a banner will proclaim across the top of every Google search whenever the malware is detected. Clicking a link in the banner leads to instructions on how to find an appropriate anti-virus program to remove the software.</p>

<p>The malware that Google is detecting routes certain Web requests through proxy servers controlled by the criminals behind the malware. Any search made through one of these proxies will receive the warning message. Use of the proxies is generally transparent to users; typically, the malware modifies the user's hosts file. The hosts file is used to map domain names to IP addresses, so that domain names can be looked up without having to use a DNS server.</p>

<p>It's likely that the malware authors will respond to this measure soon enough, however. The malicious proxy servers are already used to rewriting pages to include ads and interfere with access to anti-virus software; those proxy servers can equally remove Google's warning message.</p>

<p>One potential problem is that rather than recommend or link to specific anti-virus software, Google refers users simply to a Google search for "antivirus." Such searches can direct users to the abundant fake anti-virus software that is available on the Web; in attempting to fix the problem, users may just end up making things worse. Specific recommendations or hardcoded links to genuine anti-virus software might risk claims of favoritism, but it would probably be safer.</p>

<p>Worse, these warning messages run counter to training and advice that's often given to Web users. Due to the proliferation of fake anti-virus scams, users are strongly advised to <em>ignore</em> any website that's telling them they have a virus and that they should just download a program to fix their computer. To be effective, Google's new malware detection requires and encourages them to ignore this usually sound advice; taken in isolation, Google's warnings are sensible progress, but the broader implications could yet be negative.</p>         </div>

        <div class="teaser">
        <p>Three weeks after the public coming-out of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2011/06/inside-google-how-the-search-giant-plans-to-go-social.ars">Google's new social networking initiative</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a>, Apple has finally approved the native Google+ app for iOS devices. The <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?tmpid=1826&amp;offerid=146261&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fgoogle%252Fid447119634%253FpartnerId%253D30%2526mt%253D8%2526uo%253D4&amp;id=HsTyQA1NENk&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0">free app</a> is only compatible with iPhones though&#8212;not only is the Google+ app not configured for iPad screens, we're already hearing reports from readers that it straight up won't load on the iPad, nor will it load on the iPod touch. </p>

<p>This is a confusing decision, and Google's response to our inquiries about it didn't answer the "why." The company did, however, passively indicate that it's working on separate apps for those platforms, so it's possible that we may see multiple versions of Google+ for iOS soon: "We are working quickly to roll out the Google+ mobile app to as many platforms and devices as possible. Today we have only announced availability for the iPhone," Google spokesperson Katie Watson told Ars.</p>

<p>Device compatibility is somewhat of a major issue for us iOS users, but we'll put it aside for now to focus on the 1.0 app's functionality. It's worth noting that the Google+ mobile site works on all devices (iPod touch included!), and is almost perfectly fine for the iPhone as well, save for the lack of image uploading ability. But Google didn't just add the ability to upload images and call it a native app&#8212;the app available in the App Store works in slightly different ways than the mobile Web app, and we like what we see so far.</p>         </div>

The long-anticipated US release of the music streaming service <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2011/07/music-service-spotify-finally-to-launch-in-us-on-thursday-morning.ars">Spotify finally happened last week</a>. With a free version that gives users access to millions of songs in a highly stable desktop app, Spotify stands to make a solid impact among&nbsp;American&nbsp;music listeners. The subscription versions, however, face stiffer competition from competing services like Rdio and Napster.</p>
<p>
Americans gazed longingly over at the enormous music catalog Spotify provided to Europeans for nearly two years before its arrival here. Now that it's finally reached US turf, invites to the free tier of Spotify have become highly sought after and batches of invites have been distributed through different outlets.

        <p>Mozilla aims to simplify account registration and authentication on the Web with a new technology called BrowserID. It is a decentralized authentication system allows the Web browser to manage the user's identity.</p>

<p>The system relies on asymmetric keys and ties the user's identity to their e-mail address rather than conventional usernames and passwords.

        <div class="teaser">
        <p>Internet Explorer 9's dual-pronged approach to blocking access to malicious URLs&#8212;SmartScreen Filter to block bad URLs, and Application Reputation to detect untrustworthy executables&#8212;provides the best socially engineered malware blocking of any stable browser version, according to NSS Labs' <a href="http://www.nsslabs.com/research/endpoint-security/browser-security/web-browser-group-test-socially-engineered-malware-europe-q2-2011.html">latest report</a>. Internet Explorer 9 blocked 92 percent of malware with its URL-based filtering, and 100 percent with Application-based filtering enabled. Internet Explorer 8, in second place, blocked 90 percent of malware. Tied for third place were Safari 5, Chrome 10, and Firefox 4, each blocking just 13 percent. Bringing up the rear was Opera 11, blocking just 5 percent of malware.</p>


<p>The study only looked at sites that depended on tricking users into installing malicious software; anything that used browser flaws to run wasn't included in the test. The focus was also exclusively on malware targeting European users, though Internet Explorer 9 has also scored highly in other tests by the company with a global purview. The URLs visited were harvested from spam e-mails, instant messages, and social network posts.</p>

<p>The essentially identical performance of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome is because they use the same source data for their URL blacklisting: Google's Safe Browsing system. Some differences in lag were noticed&#8212;Firefox appeared to block bad URLs a little quicker than the other browsers&#8212;but overall performance was the same. Opera uses a service operated by anti-virus vendor AVG. Though it scored poorly, its 5 percent nonetheless represents an improvement on the zero percent it used to achieve, prior to integration of that feature. Opera was also substantially slower at blocking sites, averaging 48 hours to block, rather than 13 hours for the other browsers.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer's SmartFilter URL scanner yielded substantially better results than the other browsers tested. The Application Reputation feature then picked up any malicious executables that the URL scanner didn't trap. This shows the potential value of the Application Reputation feature; applications earn reputation by being downloaded regularly. An executable that nobody else has ever downloaded has no reputation at all, and so Internet Explorer 9 warns about the file. This means that its behavior is the reverse of the other filtering options in both Internet Explorer and other browsers: they default to permitting access to unknown URLs (as to do otherwise would break the majority of the Internet), only blocking locations that appear problematic. Application Reputation defaults to blocking.</p>

<p>Though this clearly bolsters Internet Explorer's safety, it comes at a cost, in the form of false positives. Unsigned and unusual downloads generate a warning, even for harmless programs. A Microsoft add-on for Visual Studio <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/blog/4533-this-is-why-people-ignore-security-warnings-ie9-blocks-official-microsoft-update.html">fell foul of this problem</a>, for example. Even with the false positives, Microsoft's approach appears to be more secure.</p>         </div>

        <div class="teaser">
        <p>Microsoft published, and then rapidly removed, a landing page for a new social service named "Tulalip." The page was discovered by <a href="http://fusible.com/2011/07/new-microsoft-social-search-service-called-tulalip-revealed-on-socl-com/">Fusible</a> after the site was investigating Microsoft's recent purchase of the domain "socl.com." The now-removed page described the service, saying that it would let you "Find what you need and Share what you know easier than ever," and its Metro-styled interface sported buttons to sign in with both Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>That's all gone now. In its stead, Microsoft has published a short apology, claiming that socl.com was an "internal design project" from a Microsoft Research team, published to the Web by mistake. It ends, "We didn't mean to, honest."</p>

<p>Microsoft has said in the past that it doesn't need to invent its own social network and compete head-on with the 800 lb Facebook gorilla; this is a change from the Microsoft of old, that endeavored to enter every market to avoid being left out. The official line is that "Nobody wants another Facebook", though Google apparently disagrees. Instead, Redmond has invested in and partnered with Facebook, integrating support for Facebook's services into things like Bing and Windows Live Messenger. This makes it likely that socl.com/Tulalip is some narrower take on social networking rather than some precursor to a full-blown social network.</p>

<p>One possibility engendered by the mention of searching and sharing is an expansion of the existing Bing Facebook integration. Bing already includes personalization of search results to include items liked by friends and make it easier to find people on Facebook within Bing. socl.com may be taking this further, for example to allow easier sharing of search results, or deeper search integration into Facebook and Twitter's data.</p>

<p>The company has other research projects in the social networking space. The public <a href="http://spindex.cloudapp.net/">Spindex</a> prototype aggregates social feeds. Its unique twist is trend identification; not the generic system-wide trends found in Twitter, but rather detection of trends among your own feeds, to make it easier to see at a glance what your contacts are all yammering about.</p>

<p>If Microsoft did want to enter the social networking market, it would be well-positioned, as the company already has much of the ground work done. With Windows Live Messenger and Hotmail, it already has a large network of interconnected accounts and friendship relationships. Windows Live's <a href="https://profile.live.com/">profile pages</a> are not a million miles away from the kind of thing seen on Facebook or Google+, and status updates and sharing are already available.</p>

<p>For the time being, however, aggregation is name of the game, with the company quietly working to make Windows Live a one-stop aggregator of every social network around (though <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/09/windows-live-messenger-dominating-facebook-twitter-nonexistant.ars">Twitter remains an omission</a> due to Terms of Service issues). This gives Windows Live all the trappings of a social networking site&#8212;just without a network of its own.</p>         </div>

        <div class="teaser">
        
<p>Adobe has released the first beta of Flash 11, a major update of the rich media browser plug-in. A significant change in this version of Flash is the availability of 64-bit builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The long-overdue delivery of 64-bit support is a major milestone for Adobe. The company first demonstrated an experimental 64-bit Flash plug-in prototype in 2008 and vowed to eventually deliver support for the x64 architecture across all of the major desktop operating systems. The plan had to take a backseat, however, as Adobe's focus shifted to other priorities. Improving Flash's performance and reliability on mobile devices has consumed much of the company's attention over the past year.</p>

<p>Adobe <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/06/64-bit-flash-for-linux-dropped-as-adobe-preps-next-version.ars">dropped</a> its previous experimental 64-bit Flash plug-in roughly a year ago, citing the need for significant architectural changes. At the time, we joked that Flash's 64-bit support might finally land at about the same time as <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>. It's sort of funny how that worked out. Unlike Duke's less-than-triumphant return, however, the new 64-bit Flash plugin actually lives up to its promise.</p>

<p>Linux users have typically had to rely on frameworks like nspluginwrapper to use the 32-bit Flash plug-in in a 64-bit browser. Due to native 64-bit support, the new beta version of the Flash plug-in can be used without a shim. We briefly tested it on Ubuntu 11.04 in the Firefox Web browser. In light of Adobe's controversial decision to discontinue Adobe AIR on the Linux platform, it's a bit surprising that it is treating the operating system as a first-class citizen with 64-bit support in Flash 11.</p>

<p>In addition to 64-bit support, the new plug-in also introduces the new Stage3D APIs&#8212;Adobe's Molehill project&#8212;which provides hardware-accelerated 3D rendering capabilities in the same vein as WebGL. The runtime has also gained improved JSON handling and some technical improvements that make garbage collection less intrusive. Another nice addition is support for H.264 encoding of real-time video streams captured from the user's camera&#8212;offering better compression for video chat and other similar kinds of applications.</p>

<p>The plug-in is available for <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer11.html">download</a> from Adobe's website in 32-bit and 64-bit flavors. Adobe warns, however, that the beta is still a work in progress and not intended for serious day-to-day use. I didn't encounter any serious problems during my brief test of the plugin.&nbsp;</p><p>For more details, you can refer to the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2011/07/adobe-air-3-and-flash-player-11-desktop-beta-for-developers-now-available.html">official announcement</a> in the Adobe Flash Player Team blog.</p>         </div>

        <div class="teaser">
        <p><strong>Update</strong>: The US launch has officially happened, though you wouldn't necessarily know it by looking at Spotify's website. According to the company's e-mailed press release, the tiers of service are indeed the same as those in the UK, with the unlimited tier at $4.99 and the premium tier at $9.99. The company is slowly handing out invitations for the free service, but there is a way to bypass the wait for an invitation: get out your wallet and subscribe to one of the paid tiers.</p>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Don't look now, but music service Spotify will be available to US residents starting Thursday, July 14. The company announced its... planned announcement on Wednesday, saying that it would provide further details about its US offerings at 8am EDT on Thursday. The company is currently accepting requests for invitations on its <a href="http://www.spotify.com/int/coming-to-the-us/">website</a>. </p>

<p>Spotify's streaming music and subscription service has long been popular among many of our friends in Europe since its launch in late 2008, and has been aiming for a US launch for nearly as long. (Our sister site <em><a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/04/spotify-opens-a/">Wired</a></em> spoke highly about Spotify in 2009, describing it as "a magical version of iTunes in which you&#8217;ve already bought every song in the world.") </p>

<p>The holdup on the US launch has apparently been due to licensing concerns with the record labels&#8212;much of the Spotify-related news cycle over the last several months has been made up of rumors about Spotify signing deals with this <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/02/spotify-is-inching-closer-to.ars">label</a> or the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/01/spotify-is-now-a-money-making.ars">other</a>. Even in Europe, Spotify has reportedly clashed a bit with the labels, which resulted in the company <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2011/04/pressure-from-big-labels-seen-driving-spotify-free-music-cutbacks.ars">cutting back on some of its free music offerings</a> due to supposed pressure from the music industry. </p>

<p>Now the day has finally come&#8212;or will come tomorrow, that is&#8212;for those in the US to find out why folks in Europe seem to love Spotify so much. Because Spotify chose not to actually announce the details when sending out its PR e-mails, however, no further information is yet available as to what may or may not be included in the service. Here's what's currently available in the UK though:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spotify.com/uk/get-spotify/overview/">Spotify's three tiers</a>&nbsp;of free, unlimited, and premium music. The free tier lets you stream 10 hours of music per month with ads (and unlimited local music), while the unlimited tier offers unlimited ad-free streams, and the premium tier offers all of that plus offline mode and access from your mobile phone. We can only assume that the service structure will be the same for US customers, but we'll have to wait until tomorrow morning to find out for sure. </p>         </div>

                <div class="byline">by <span class="author"><a rel="author" href="http://arstechnica.com/author/jacqui-cheng/">Jacqui Cheng</a>
</span> | <span class="posted"><span class="published"><span class="name">Published </span> <abbr class="timeago datetime" title="2011-07-12T17:25:00Z">July 12, 2011 12:25 PM</abbr></span> (Cross posted from Media)</span></div>
        
        

              
        
        <div class="teaser">
        
<p>Netflix users who want both streaming content and DVDs delivered to their homes will now have to subscribe to two separate plans at $15.98 per month. Netflix announced the changes to its pricing structures on the <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-introduces-new-plans-and.html">company blog</a> Tuesday, pointing out that there are now completely separate streaming-only and DVD-only plans, and none that include both. The changes go into effect in September for existing subscribers, or immediately for new Netflix members.</p>

<p>Netflix made a name for itself by offering unlimited DVDs delivered to subscribers' houses, but soon became popular for its instant streaming offerings that were rolled into the normal DVD plans. In November of 2010, the company finally <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2010/11/netflix-intros-799-streaming-only-plan-bumps-dvd-prices.ars">decided to offer a streaming-only plan</a> for $7.99 per month&#8212;$1 less than the previous streaming <em>and</em> one-DVD-at-a-time plan&#8212;with DVD plans as a $2 add-on. So, for unlimited streaming and one DVD at a time, users could still pay $9.99 per month to get both.</p>

<p>No longer is that the case, though. Now, there will be a $7.99 streaming-only plan and a $7.99 DVD-only plan, and if you want both, you'll have to subscribe to both. That's $5.99 more per month than the previous plan for similar features, or $71.88 more per year.</p>

<p>Netflix VP of marketing Jessie Becker wrote that the company had never intended to offer DVD-only plans until after the streaming-only plan went into effect. "Since then we have realized that there is still a very large continuing demand for DVDs both from our existing members as well as non-members," she wrote. "Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs. Creating an unlimited DVDs by mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs by mail offering."</p>

<p>Now, movie lovers will <em>really</em> have to decide whether the DVD option is worth the extra money&#8212;when it was only a $2 add-on, it was easy to toss in, but an extra $8 might be harder to swallow. Netflix's streaming library is growing at a much faster rate now, but the best movies are still usually limited to DVD on Netflix for quite a while before they become stream-able. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Amazon continues to add more titles to its <a href="http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2011/02/amazon-takes-on-netflix-with-movie-streaming-service-for-prime.ars">own streaming library tied to Amazon Prime</a>, and Amazon's service is still cheaper than Netflix's streaming-only service by about $17 per year. Amazon, however, doesn't offer any sort of DVD rental option like Netflix, so Netflix may still have the widest overall appeal, even with the subscription price increases. </p>         </div>

        <p>Facebook held a special media event on Wednesday to introduce "awesome" new Facebook features. It turns out the company <a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150223135777131">unveiled improvements to Facebook Chat</a>, including a new group chatting feature and, in partnership with Skype, the ability to make video calls. While the improvements are welcome&#8212;numerous other services such as AIM, iChat, Windows Live, and Yahoo have had similar features for some time&#8212;they are also far from the promised "awesome."</p>

<p>The staff in the Ars Orbiting HQ took the new features for a spin, and shortcomings were immediately obvious. While the service is based on Skype's technology, you can't make video calls with other Skype users. Video chats are only two-way, so no chatting among groups like in&nbsp;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2011/06/inside-google-how-the-search-giant-plans-to-go-social.ars">Google+'s new "hangout" feature</a>. And text chat is stuck in the browser while video chats launch in a separate window that remains on top of all other windows, making it difficult to access other work while chatting.</p>

<p>However, Facebook's massive user base could make the new features useful, especially for those that don't heavily rely on other, more entrenched services like AIM or Skype. Here are some of the thoughts bandied about our in-orbit water cooler this afternoon.</p>  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2011/07/facebook-video-chatting-handy-definitely-not-awesome.ars" class="read-more">( More &hellip; )</a>         </div>

        <p>June brought the first result of Mozilla's new Rapid Release strategy for Firefox. Firefox 4, just three months old, was superceded by the all-new but not-too-different <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/06/firefox-5-released-arrives-only-three-months-after-firefox-4.ars">Firefox 5</a>.

        <p>If things continue down their current path, Amazon's affiliate program will eventually go extinct in the US. Late Wednesday, California joined the growing list of states attempting to collect sales tax from online retailers like Amazon in an effort to help close the state's vast budget deficit. Amazon, in typical fashion, has aggressively pushed back, warning its California-based affiliates that they'll have their revenue streams cut off as of September 30 if the law ends up being enacted. (<strong>Update</strong>: Amazon has informed its California affiliates that it's shutting down the program immediately and not waiting until September.)</p>

<p>California's new law, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2011/06/jerry-brown-signs-laws-redevelopment-agencies-taxes-online-retailers.html">signed</a> by Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday, requires online retailers to collect sales tax even if they have no physical presence in the state. How does that work when federal law states they have to have a brick-and-mortar store to qualify? Like the many other states before it, California counts Amazon affiliates who reside in California as a "physical presence." So, if Joe Blow runs a personal blog with affiliate links to Amazon products (you know, to make a few bucks on the side), he is effectively "selling" Amazon products and making money from them via his home in California. </p>         </div>

        <p>Microsoft has <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/">released</a> a new Internet Explorer 10 preview, the second pre-release of Internet Explorer 10 designed to give developers access to the new technologies that Internet Explorer 10 will deliver. The new version includes support for a bunch of new specifications, enabling better support for drag and drop, form validation, positioning of page elements, and more. As with prior preview releases, Microsoft has also provided a number of demo sites to show off new capabilities, and new test cases to demonstrate exact conformance with the HTML5 specifications.</p>

<p>This update comes 11 weeks after the first preview release, making it a little ahead of schedule; Internet Explorer 9 previews came out roughly every eight weeks, but for Internet Explorer 10, Microsoft is aiming at one every three months.</p>         </div>

<p>Hold onto your hats: Congress has finally discovered Skype. The US House of Representatives Committee on Administration announced on Tuesday that its WiFi network officially supports the use of <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> and <a href="http://www.oovoo.com/">ooVoo</a>, which is meant to enable Congress members and staffers to video conference with constituents while saving money on travel costs. The agreement has apparently been in the works for months, and has now come to fruition after smoothing out the House's security concerns. </p>

<p>&#8220;During a time when Congress must do more with less, we believe that these low-cost, real-time communication tools will be an effective way to inform and solicit feedback from constituents," Committee on House Administration Chairman Dan Lungren (R-CA) and House Technology Operations Team Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) said in a statement. "We thank the CAO for ensuring that Members and staff can utilize these services while maintaining the necessary level of IT security within the House network, and look forward to identifying additional technological solutions to communication and transparency roadblocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/en/2011/06/skype_is_in_da_house.html">Skype Blog</a>, lawmakers will use Skype to hold meetings with those who can't travel to the Congressional office, participate in virtual town meetings, and "collaborate more effectively with other Members on important legislative efforts." </p>

<p>As far as security goes, Skype says that each Congressional office will be able to configure its own settings with a Skype Manager account, and reassures us that no one will be Skype-spying on the Congressional offices without their permission: "Skype software allows people to accept or block a contact, and it never 'answers' a call unless instructed to do so by the user. In other words, Skype video calls are initiated only when users at all ends of the call make the affirmative choice to enable video calling." </p><p>ooVoo went into slightly more detail about the process that led to the agreement. "ooVoo is making available to House Members our Professional version
which offers cloud-based SSL data encryption," ooVoo spokesperson Bryan Brown told Ars via e-mail. "Over a period of months,
the House Technology Operations team reviewed ooVoo's architecture and
security throughout the process.  The team understood the cloud-driven
nature of ooVoo as a differentiator in terms of security and user
experience."</p>

<p>In a way, it's surprising that Congress members couldn't previously use videoconferencing services to communicate with constituents&#8212;after all, many already use e-mail to do so&#8212;but security was the main concern that held back the adoption of more feature-rich technologies. Chaffetz had previously told <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/168727-house-enables-use-of-skype-video-teleconferencing-for-members?utm_campaign=HilliconValley&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">The Hill</a> that the Technology Operations Team was worried about broadcasting classified items and wanted to ensure that the cameras couldn't be remotely activated. According to Lungren, however, those concerns have been resolved and all members and staff will need to accept "House-specific agreements" in order to "maximize protection" for all involved. </p>         </div>

        <div class="teaser">
        <p>Though Apple hasn't publicly disclosed any major upcoming improvements for iOS's Maps app, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/23/evidence-in-ios-5-that-apple-is-building-its-own-mapping-solution/">new legal notices</a> contained within iOS 5 suggest Apple is still hard at work developing improvements to its mapping and geolocation features.</p>

<p>After acquiring two map data processing companies, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/10/apple-may-have-google-maps-replacement-waiting-in-the-wings.ars">PlaceBase</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/07/apple-boosting-mapping-mashup-skills-with-poly9-acquisition.ars">Poly9</a>, it seemed Apple was in a position to drop its reliance on Google for its Maps application. Google has increasingly become a competitor for Apple in the smartphone market and mobile advertising, so at least exploring alternatives to Google's mapping data was seen as a wise move on Apple's part.</p>

<p>We believed that Apple would <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/03/rumor-voice-controlled-cloud-streaming-lte-iphone-this-fall.ars">roll those improvements into iOS 5</a>&nbsp;based on repeated rumors that Apple would add location check-in and other new features to MobileMe. However, Apple announced in June that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/06/apple-details-iclouds-digital-storage-and-syncing-free-5gb-of-storage.ars">iCloud would replace MobileMe</a> without any mention of new geolocation capabilities. Furthermore, Google's Eric Schmidt recently revealed his company had signed a new map agreement with Apple, indicating that the companies still plan to stick together for a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We just renewed our Map and Search agreements with Apple, and we hope those continue for a long time," Schmidt <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/05/31/apple-just-renewed-maps-and-search-partnership-with-google/">said</a> during the D9 conference in late May.</p>

<p>Despite all this, a string of new mapping-related legal notices contained in iOS 5 reveal that Apple still plans to use map and location data from a variety of new sources. Among those mentioned are TomTom, Urban Mapping, Localeze, and CoreLogic. These sources offer mapping data, property boundaries, local business information, and neighborhood data, among other things.</p>

<p>How Apple plans to use all this data is still a mystery, but the company <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703367004576288790268529716.html">admitted</a> that anonymous geolocation data collected from iPhones will power a future real-time traffic data feature. PlaceBase and Poly9 both excelled at combining mapping data with other sources of geolocation-tagged information, so it's clear Apple intends to offer improved location-based data visualizations of some kind. We may find out just what Apple will do with all the extra data once  iOS 5 is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/06/ios-5-overhauls-notifications-messaging-while-cutting-the-usb-cord.ars">released this fall</a>.</p>         </div>

<p>Google is about to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365957/">get served</a>&#8212;with a civil subpoena, that is. The Federal Trade Commission is on the verge of serving Google as part of a formal antitrust investigation into Google's Web dominance, according to sources speaking to the <em><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303339904576403603764717680.html">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, with the requests for more information expected to be sent to Google "within days." </p>

<p>The <em>WSJ</em>'s sources say that the FTC's investigation will focus on Google's advertising business and whether Google has been directing search users to its own services over the competition. As is typical with investigations like this, the FTC will eventually begin requesting information from other companies that deal with Google as well in order to get further information on how Google conducts its business.</p>         </div>

<strong>Q: I heard about Twitpic commercializing user-uploaded photos and became curious. There are alternatives out there, but what are the chances they all have similar terms of service? Is there <em>any</em> service that isn't my own website that won't commercialize my photos? Is this just a standard agreement, or what?</strong>
</p>

<p>You're correct about Twitpic commercializing user photos: the company recently announced that it was the "exclusive photo agency partner" of the World Entertainment News Network (WENN). This agreement allows WENN to sell images uploaded to Twitpic and to pursue copyright action against parties who try to use those images commercially without authorization. </p>         </div>

        <p>Google has created a new tool that allows those who install it to see security holes on websites, the company announced on their <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-dom-snitch-our-passive-in.html">security blog</a> Tuesday. Named DOM Snitch, the Chrome extension uses various ways of intercepting Javascript calls to spot the use of functions that can inject code from outside sources. Google intends it to help&nbsp;show developers where their client-side code needs work.</p>
<p>
The company notes that, as Web applications become more complex, the number and kinds of attacks that can be successfully launched against them will increase. Google hopes that the tool will help developers, testers, and security professionals tie up more loose ends with their code and prevent client-side attacks.
</p>
<p>
While it's still in an experimental phase, DOM Snitch can intercept many different kinds of Javascript calls and then record the&nbsp;URLs accessed by a&nbsp;document and a complete stack trace. This set of information lets developers and testers see if any interlopers who intercept a call would be able to progress to "cross-site scripting, mixed content," or "insecure modifications to the same-origin policy for DOM access." Users can see DOM modifications in real time, and can export the results of the test to share with colleagues.</p>
<p>
DOM Snitch seems like more of a teaching tool or sanity check than a must-have security essential, but it may still see wide use among those still learning how to write secure Javascript code. At least a few users won't be able to resist using the tool for a little public shaming of popular, security-negligent websites.

Best Buy has entered the cloud-based music storage fray with a service named Best Buy Music Cloud. The program's pared-down Web and desktop presences have very little information on the details of how the service is supposed to work, but the basic uploading and listening functionalities on those incarnations appear to have made it into the soft launch intact.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-buy-soft-launches-music-cloud-service/">Digital Trends</a>, the service hasn't "officially" launched yet, though the website and desktop apps are fully accessible and based on PlayAnywhere technology by Catch Media. Users can sign up at the <a href="http://www.bestbuymusiccloud.com/">website</a> right now, where the first form you're given to fill out is one about the make, carrier, and number of  your cell phone (though this step is skippable).
</p>
<p>
In the next step, users can download the desktop app that will ostensibly begin syncing music and playlists from your iTunes library to the cloud (though at this time, our app has been stuck on the 62nd song of 5,606 for about 15 minutes). If you happened to give Best Buy your phone's information, around this time you'll get a text message telling you the mobile native apps aren't available yet, along with an activation code.
</p>
<p>
Best Buy's service, similar to Apple's iTunes in the Cloud, will allow users to pin songs down to their devices so they don't always have to be streamed, which saves a little on the limited data plans afforded most smartphones. The service has two pricing tiers: free, described in one line as "web + limited only" on the Web player, and a premium version for $3.99.

<a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/22/best-buy-takes-on-apple-amazon-with-new-cloud-music-service/">Boy Genius Report</a> says only premium subscribers will have access to the mobile apps for the service.&nbsp;</p><p>Worse, according to this Best Buy <a href="http://www.bestbuymobile.com/article/inside-best-buy-music-cloud">blog post</a>, the free version only lets customers hear the first 30 seconds of their own songs. Best Buy did not respond immediately to requests for clarification on this and other aspects of the cloud music service.</p>

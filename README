Given a html document, it pulls out the main body text and cleans it up.
It also can clean up title based on latest readability.js code.

Based on:
 - Latest readability.js ( https://github.com/MHordecki/readability-redux/blob/master/readability/readability.js )
 - Ruby port by starrhorne and iterationlabs
 - Python port by gfxmonk ( https://github.com/gfxmonk/python-readability , based on BeautifulSoup )
 - Decruft effort to move to lxml ( http://www.minvolai.com/blog/decruft-arc90s-readability-in-python/ )

Usage:

    import urllib
    html = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
    readable_article = Document(html).summary()
    readable_title = Document(html).short_title()

Known Issues

wget and parsing of wget is not as reliable as it should be.  wget sometimes
fails because the names of the local files that it tries create are too long,
so we end up with no local copy of necessary files.  The parsing is also not
that robust, so create incorrect mappings in the generated URL map.
